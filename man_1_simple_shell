.SH NAME
.B Simple shell -- UNIX simple command language interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY simple_shell
.YS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The simple_shell program is a command language interpreter that
executes commands reads from a command line string, the standard input,
or specified file.

The simple_shell is intended to simulate the basic functions contained
on the original shell used by the bash. The functionality are execution
of simple commands and execution of builtin commands like exit and env.

.SH INVOCATION
.PP
The simple_shell is considered an interactive
shell. An interactive shell generally prompts before each command and
handles programming and command errors differently.
When first starting,
the simple_shell inspects argument 0.

If command line arguments besides the options have been specified,
then the simple_shell treats the first argument as the name of a file
from which to read commands (a shell script), and the remaining
arguments are set as the positional parameters of the simple_shell.
Otherwise, the simple_shell reads commands from its standart input
using getline function.

.SH ARGUMENTS
the simple shell takes as the name of the command the fisrt argument
passed to the interactive prompt  and the positional parameters
are set to the remaining arguments.

\fBsimple_shell\fP's exit status is the exit status of the last command
executed in the script.
If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0.
An attempt is first made to open the file in the current directory, and,
if no file is found, then the shell searches the directories in
.SM
.B PATH
for the script.

.SH SHELL GRAMMAR
.SS simple commands
A
.I simple command
is a sequence of optional variable assigments followed by
.B blank-separated
words and  terminated by a
.B control operator.
The first word specifies the command to be executed, and is passed
as argument zero. The remaining words are passed as arguments to the
invoked command.

The return value of a simple command is its exit status.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION

After a command has been split into words, if it results  in  a  simple
command  and  an  optional list of arguments, the following actions are
taken.

If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts  to  locate
it. If  there  exists a shell function by that name, that function is
invoked.  If the name does not match  a function,  the shell searches
for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a match is found, that builtin
is invoked.

If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains  no
slashes, simple_shell  searches  each element of the PATH for a directory
containing an executable file by that name. A full search of the
directories in  PATH  is performed. If the search is unsuccessful,
the shell prints an error message  and  returns an exit status of 127.

If  the  search  is  successful, or if the command name contains one or
more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate
execution environment.  Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the
remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.

.SH EXAMPLE
The following exmaples shows how to perform the different execution
of a command on the simple_shell to list all the files on the /usr
directory with the long format argument.
.TP
1. ls -l /usr --> interactive mode
.TP
2. echo "ls -l /usr" | ./simple_shell --> pipe mode
